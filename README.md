# TriviaGame

### How to get started

To get started having fun with the game, users must go to https://tothinator.github.io/unit-4-game/ and click the start button! (hint: you can cheat by looking in the console)

### Design Choices

I didn't spend a lot of time on style for this game, but questions are filled dynamically.  Therefore I can easily add more question variables with more questions and they will fill the page and calculate the score no matter how many are added.

### Code Design

I spent a lot of time fleshing out resuable functions for this project, and I think that a lot of people will find the code approachable and easy to read.  I think adding more comments and rearranging the functions in the order they are used might also help.

### Possible future improvements

1.  I think I need to add a lot of styling to the page to make it more visually appealling.
2.  I also think upgrading to show one question at a time and adding gifs, ect. in-between would be a good thing to add that is related to #1.
